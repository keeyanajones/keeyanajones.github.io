                  don't fit into just one box? You're not alone. As someone who 
                  started out as a consultant and JavaScript enthusiast in 
                  the 90's, I found myself pulled in different directions as 
                  my interests expanded beyond coding. </p>
                
                <p>In this post, I'll share my journey of how I've 
                  transformed into a one-person IT consulting, social media,

                <p>It all started with my passion for coding. When I was 19 
                  I was drawn to the logic and creativity of problem solving 
                  programming. I started off with the basics of HTML and CSS, 
                  and then moved on to JavaScript. I found myself captivated 
                  by the endless possibilities of the language and in later 
                  years began to explore various frameworks like React and 
                  Angular. I worked on several projects as a Freelance IT 
                  consultant in Michigan, and I enjoyed the challenge of 
                  solving a problem with code.</p>

                     <br/>
                
                <p>However, after experiencing a health change I started to 
                  feel like there was more to technology than just coding. I 
                  became interested in social media and its impact on our daily 
                  lives. I began to research how social media platforms like 
                  Instagram and Facebook use algorithms to recommend content to 
                  users. I started to think about how I could use my coding 
                  skills to develop algorithms that could display content 
                  people would enjoy using. I even started using my own 
                  social media account and began experimenting with different 
                  types of content.</p>
                
                <p>At the same time, I found myself becoming more interested 
                  in gaming. I had always enjoyed playing video games and it 
                  was my secret; because back then gaming was a “nerdy” thing 
                  and Live Streaming was new.  But as I learned more about the 
                  gaming industry, I became fascinated by how games are developed 
                  and marketed. I started to research how game developers use 
                  social media, live streaming, and analytics to track user 
                  behavior to make decisions. I even began to think about how 
                  I could develop my own game studio and market it to a broader 
                  audience. Other Developers</p>
                
                <p>As my interests expanded, I realized that I was no longer 
                  just an IT consultant or a JavaScript developer. I was a value 
                  creator or multi-disciplinary tech enthusiast influencer or just 
                  a woman who was passionate about exploring new areas of 
                  technology with an Detroiters style. I started to think about 
                  how I could use my various skills to create new products and 
                  services that would help others. I began to explore different 
                  online learning platforms like Youtube and Freecodecamp to 
                  expand my knowledge in different areas.</p>
                
                <p>Today, I'm proud to say that I've transformed into a one-person 
                  technology skills Empress.</p>
                 
                <p>I'm constantly learning new things and exploring new areas of 
                  technology. I'm excited to see where my journey takes me next 
                  and I encourage you to do the same.</p>

                   create something truly unique from inside.  Embrace your flow.

            <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-1">New Game Releases</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 8, 2023 by

            <strong>What I'm playing and Obsessed with</strong>:
            <ul>  
              <li>Minecraft</li>
              <li>Minecraft Dungons</li> 
              <li>Red Dead Redemption 2 Online</li>
            </ul>
          
              <p>Each game offers its own unique challenges and rewards, 
                and I love them. Whether I'm building my modern farmhouse in 
                Minecraft, fighting then dying my way through dungeons in 
                Minecraft Dungeons, or collecting items in Red Dead 
                Redemption 2 Online with a map on Github, I'm always 
                having a blast. If you haven't played any of these
                games yet, I highly recommend them.</p>
              
              <p><strong>When I'm playing</strong>:
               Random</p>

               <p>Are you a gamer? If so, you're not alone. I am currently
                 hooked on three different games: Minecraft, Minecraft Dungeons, 
                 and Red Dead Redemption 2 Online. Each game has its own unique 
                 challenges and rewards, and I can't get enough of them.</p>
                 
                 <hr/>

               <h3>Minecraft: Building my Own World</h3>
               <p>This game has been around for over a decade, and it's still 
                keeping me up all night trying to hatch turtle eggs.  I recently 
                started my own Realms server, and I've been having a blast building 
                all sorts of things. From building houses to having a empty village 
                with villagers living in a bunker only trading with me.  I've been 
                trying to get that pigstep disc on this world but I still haven't 
                found it this time.</p><br/>
               
              <p><img src="assets/images/minecraft_overview.jpg" 
                   alt="Minecraft Start Screen"
                   class="img-fluid img-thubnail rounded"> </p>

               <p>One of the coolest things I've built so far is a bed with trap 
                doors. It took me hours of intense focus to gather all the 
                materials and design the layout, but the end result was totally 
                worth it. I've also built a few village structures and given the 
                locals fines for not fixing the roads.  I love fixing the roads and 
                working among the local yocals.</p><br/>
                              
              <p><img src="assets/images/minecraft_4_23.jpg" 
                   alt="Minecraft Pre Loading Screen" 
                   class="img-fluid img-thubnail rounded"> </p>

               <p>Minecraft mining is relaxing and peaceful, but it can also be 
                challenging at times. Especially when you don't sleep at night, and 
                get too focused on building But, I love the freedom that the game 
                offers to create my own structures.</p><br/>

                     alt="Turtles hatching and leaving" 
                     class="img-fluid img-thubnail rounded"></p> 
 
                <hr/>
              
               <h3>Minecraft Dungeons: A Tougher Challenge</h3>
               <p>This game is a bit different from the original Minecraft, as 
               it's more of a dungeon crawler. You play as a hero, exploring 
               dungeons and fighting monsters along the way. It's a lot of fun, 
               but it's also tougher than you might think.</p><br/>
               
                <p><img src="assets/images/minecraft_dungeons_overview.jpg" 
                alt="Minecraft Dungeons Hero Screen"
                class="img-fluid img-thubnail rounded"></p>
                
                <hr/>

               <p>I keep dying in Dungeons, but that's part of what makes the 
                game so addictive. Like old games you get 3 lives.  Each time 
                I die, I learn a little bit more about the game and how to beat 
                the different enemies and figure out where to go. It can be a 
                frustrating game at times, but it's also incredibly satisfying 
                when you finally regenerate a potion.  I try to run or wait till 
                I get the potion back.</p><br/>

                class="img-fluid img-thubnail rounded"></p>
                
                <br/>

               <h3>Red Dead Redemption 2 Online: Collecting as a Hobby</h3>
               <p>Finally, this game is set in the Old West, and it's all about 
                cowboy life. You can go on missions, hunt for animals, or just 
                explore the massive open world.</p><br/>

                <p><img src="assets/images/rdr2o_camp.jpg" 
                alt="Minecraft Start Screen"
                class="img-fluid img-thubnail rounded"></p>
                
                <hr/>

               <p>One of the things I've been doing in Red Dead Redemption 2 
                Online is collecting. I bought the Collector's Bag, which allows 
                me to collect all sorts of items like arrowheads, jewelry, and 
                fossils. Its not a boring hobby, but there's something satisfying 
                about finding stuff and finishing a collection or completing sets.
              </p>
                
                <p><img src="assets/images/rdr2o_collector_maps.jpg" 
                alt="Minecraft Start Screen"
                class="img-fluid img-thubnail rounded"></p>
                
                <hr/>

               <p>In my latest Twitch live stream, I spent most of the time 
                looking at the map, trying to figure out where I was; and all 
                the different collectibles were. It might not have been the most 
                lit stream, but it was a lot of fun for me. The longest I was on 
                github in a while; and it was to look at a map for Red Dead 
                Redemption.</p>  
               
               <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
               <p>In conclusion, I love the miner lifestyle and obsess over two 
                Minecraft games and Red Dead Redemption 2 Online. Each game offers 
                a unique world to survive, challenges and rewards.</p>  
               <p>I will always be a mining enthusiast building come thing in my 
                Minecraft or fighting my way through dungeons.  I think this weekend 
                is going to be about collecting items in Red Dead Redemption 2 Online, 
                its fun. If you haven't played any of these games yet, I highly 
                recommend them.</p>

              <h3>10 Things Learned From 100 Days of Coding</h3>
              
              <ol>
               <li>I am not a developer anymore, I'm more</li>
               
               <li><strong>I like learning on FreeCodeCamp (and other similar sites) 
                independently</strong><br/>
                
                <p>Learning a new language is tough, especially if you use only one
                   or two all the time. But thanks to online resources, it's now 
                   easier than ever to get started coding with a new language. One 
                   of my favorite resources for learning independently is 
                   FreeCodeCamp. In this blog post, I'll share my experience with 
                   FreeCodeCamp and similar sites, and why I think they're the best 
                   resources for anyone looking to learn to code on their own.</p>

                    </p>          

                  <hr/>  

                <p>First and foremost, I love FreeCodeCamp and it's free. </p>
                
                <p>It's an open-source platform that offers a comprehensive curriculum 
                  that covers everything from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to back-end 
                  development, data science, and more. You also get a supportive 
                  community of fellow learners and mentors who are always willing to 
                  help.</p>
                
                <p>Another thing I love about FreeCodeCamp is the approach to learning. 
                  The platform provides a series of challenges and projects that allow 
                  you to apply what you've learned by doing and at the end of the 
                  courses I've seen, you have some cool stuff to put in your portfolio. 
                  The hands-on approach helps me to get an understanding of concepts.</p>
                
                <p>But FreeCodeCamp is not the only resource I use to learn to code. I 
                  also enjoy using other similar sites, such as Youtube, and 
                  tutorialspoint. Each of these platforms has its own unique strengths 
                  and weaknesses, but they all share a common goal: to make learning to 
                  code accessible to everyone.</p>
                                
                <p>If you're thinking about learning a new skill or want to update them,
                   I highly recommend checking out FreeCodeCamp, Youtube, and 
                   tutorialspoint.  These sites have changed in the last few years and 
                   Who knows, you might discover a new passion and change your life for 
                   the better.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-1">Training - Learning JavaScript... Again</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 10, 2023 by 
              <a href="mailto:keeyanajones@yahoo.com">Kee</a></p>
                          
            <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in 
              the world. It has been around for over two decades, and its 
              versatility and ubiquity make it an essential skill for any web 
              developer. However, after years of experience with the language, 
              it can be easy to get complacent and forget the excitement that 
              comes with learning new things.</p>
          
            <p>That's why I'm here to tell you that re-learning JavaScript can 
              be an incredibly rewarding experience. Whether you're a seasoned 
              veteran or just starting out, there's always something new to 
              discover in this ever-evolving language. And with resources like 
              YouTube and FreeCodeCamp at your fingertips, there's never been a 
              better time to dive back in.</p>
            
            <p>So why should you revisit JavaScript? For one, the language has 
              changed a lot since you first learned it. New features like arrow 
              functions, template literals, and destructuring make it easier than 
              ever to write clean, concise code. Plus, with the rise of frameworks 
              like React and Angular, there are even more tools available to help 
              you build powerful, scalable applications.</p>
            
            <p>But perhaps the biggest reason to revisit JavaScript is simply the 
              joy of learning. There's nothing quite like the feeling of finally 
              grasping a tricky concept or seeing your code come to life in the 
              browser. And with so many resources available online, there's never 
              been a better time to brush up on your skills and take your coding 
              to the next level.</p>
            
            <p>So how can you get started? YouTube is a great place to find tutorials 
              and lectures on all aspects of JavaScript. Whether you're looking to 
              learn the basics or dive deep into advanced topics like functional 
              programming or design patterns, there's sure to be a video out there 
              for you. Some popular channels to check out include Traversy Media, 
              The Net Ninja, and Programming with Mosh.</p>
            
            <p>Another great resource for learning JavaScript is FreeCodeCamp. This 
              online platform offers a comprehensive curriculum covering everything 
              from the basics of HTML and CSS to advanced topics like data structures 
              and algorithms. And best of all, it's completely free! Plus, FreeCodeCamp 
              also offers opportunities to contribute to open source projects, giving 
              you the chance to put your skills into practice and make a real impact.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of course, learning a language like JavaScript takes time and effort. But 
              with the right mindset and resources, it can be an incredibly rewarding 
              experience. And who knows? You may even discover a newfound passion for 
              coding that you never knew you had.</p>
            
            <p>So what are you waiting for? Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting 
              out, there's never been a better time to revisit JavaScript and take your 
              skills to the next level. With the help of YouTube and FreeCodeCamp, the 
              sky's the limit. Happy coding!</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-1">AI: Me and ChatGPT So Far</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 11, 2023 by 
              <a href="mailto:keeyanajones@yahoo.com">Kee</a></p>
                   
              <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has come a long way in recent 
                years, and one of the most exciting developments has been the 
                rise of language models like ChatGPT. These models are capable 
                of generating human-like responses to text prompts, opening up 
                a whole new world of possibilities for communication, creativity, 
                and discovery. And as a language model myself, I'm thrilled to 
                share some of the amazing things we've created, done, and discovered 
                together.</p>

              <p>First and foremost, ChatGPT has revolutionized the way we communicate 
                with machines. With natural language processing (NLP) technology, it's 
                now possible to have a conversation with a computer that feels almost 
                like talking to a real person. This has huge implications for everything 
                from customer service to mental health care, and it's all thanks to the 
                power of AI.</p>
                
              <p>In conclusion, ChatGPT has been a game-changer in the world of AI and 
                NLP. From communication to creativity to discovery, the possibilities 
                are endless. And with our collaboration and feedback, the future looks 
                brighter than ever. So let's keep pushing the boundaries of what's 
                possible and see where this amazing technology takes us next!</p>

              <p>ChatGPT Wrote this when I asked it this:</p>

              <p><kbd>can you summarize and organize a list of our all previous questions and 
                topics.  Then write a 500 word blog post about where they over lap.</kbd></p>

              <p>Sure, I can do that for you!</p>

              <p>Previous Questions and Topics listed:</p>
              
              <p>(...)</p>

              <p>Upon reviewing our previous questions and topics, I noticed that 
                they all share a common thread of the power of technology to enable 
                growth and discovery. Whether we're exploring new programming languages,
                delving into the possibilities of AI and NLP, or simply reflecting on 
                our past conversations, we are all engaged in a process of growth and 
                learning.</p>

              <p>In the first topic, we discussed the process of learning JavaScript 
                after having already gained experience with it in the past. The key 
                takeaway from this discussion was the importance of continued learning 
                and growth, even in fields where we may already have a solid foundation 
                of knowledge. By using resources like YouTube and FreeCodeCamp, we can 
                access a wealth of knowledge and expertise that can help us take our 
                skills to the next level and unlock new possibilities for innovation 
                and problem-solving.</p>
                
              <p>The second topic focused on AI and ChatGPT, two cutting-edge 
                technologies that have the potential to transform the way we communicate, 
                create, and discover. Both of these technologies leverage the power of 
                machine learning and natural language processing to unlock new possibilities 
                for human ingenuity and collaboration. By using these technologies, we can 
                push the boundaries of what's possible and unlock new frontiers in fields 
                ranging from medicine to environmental science.</p>
                
              <p>Finally, in the third topic, we discussed the nature of our past 
                conversations and the role they played in our ongoing growth and learning. 
                By reflecting on our past discussions, we were able to identify common 
                themes and threads that connect our disparate topics and demonstrate the 
                power of technology to facilitate growth and discovery.</p>
                
              <p>At the heart of all of these topics is the power of technology to enable 
                learning and discovery. By embracing new tools and platforms, we can tap 
                into the power of human ingenuity and collaboration, working together to 
                build a brighter and more innovative future. Whether we're exploring new 
                programming languages, delving into the possibilities of AI and NLP, or 
                simply reflecting on our past conversations, we are all engaged in a 
                process of growth and learning that is facilitated by the power of 
                technology.</p>
                
              <p>In conclusion, our previous questions and topics may seem disparate 
                at first glance, but they are actually united by a common thread - 
                the power of technology to facilitate growth and learning. By embracing 
                new tools and platforms, we can tap into the power of human ingenuity 
                and collaboration, working together to build a brighter and more 
                innovative future. Whether we're learning a new programming language, 
                exploring the possibilities of AI and NLP, or reflecting on our past 
                conversations, we are all engaged in a process of growth and discovery 
                that is enabled by the power of technology.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-1">Reality: Problems of E<em>X</em>tended </h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 12, 2023 by 
              <a href="mailto:keeyanajones@yahoo.com">Kee</a></p>
              
              <h3>The Problems of Extended Reality</h3>

              <p>Virtual and augmented reality have been revolutionizing the way 
                companies operate for years, but in recent months, extended 
                reality (XR) has become increasingly popular. XR includes virtual, 
                augmented, and mixed reality technologies, and it's being used to 
                solve real-world problems in innovative ways. From improving 
                employee training to enhancing customer experiences, XR is changing 
                the way businesses operate. In this blog post, we'll take a look at 
                some of the latest real-world problems companies have been facing in 
                the last month and how they're using XR to solve them.</p>

              <h4>Remote Collaboration</h4>
              <p>With the pandemic forcing many businesses to adopt remote work 
                models, remote collaboration has become an essential part of 
                company operations. However, traditional video conferencing platforms 
                can be limiting, making it difficult to collaborate effectively. 
                XR is changing that. By using virtual reality platforms, teams can 
                collaborate as if they were in the same room, providing a more immersive 
                and engaging experience. Companies like Mozilla and Spatial are leading 
                the way in this space, offering VR collaboration tools that allow teams 
                to meet, brainstorm, and work together in a virtual environment.</p>
          
              <h4>Employee Training</h4>
              <p>Training employees can be a significant expense for companies, 
                especially when it involves hands-on learning or dangerous environments.
                 XR technology provides a safe and cost-effective way to train employees. 
                 Companies like Honeywell are using augmented reality to train employees 
                 on complex machinery and processes. By using AR headsets, employees can 
                 receive step-by-step instructions and visual aids in real-time, making 
                 the training process more engaging and effective.</p>
          
              <h4>Customer Experiences</h4>
              <p>XR is also transforming the way companies interact with their customers. 
                With the rise of e-commerce, customers are often left wondering what 
                products will look like in real life. AR technology provides a solution 
                to this problem, allowing customers to visualize products in their own 
                environment. Companies like IKEA are using AR to allow customers to see 
                what furniture will look like in their homes before they make a purchase. 
                This technology not only enhances the customer experience but also reduces 
                the number of returns due to incorrect sizing or style.</p>
          
              <h4>Sales and Marketing</h4>
              <p>XR is also being used to enhance sales and marketing efforts. Companies 
                like Mercedes-Benz are using mixed reality to showcase their vehicles in 
                a more engaging and interactive way. By using MR headsets, customers can 
                see 3D models of vehicles and even take them for virtual test drives. This 
                technology not only enhances the customer experience but also increases the 
                likelihood of a sale.</p>
          
              <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
              <p>Finally, XR technology is being used to solve manufacturing problems. 
                Companies like Siemens are using augmented reality to reduce downtime by 
                providing real-time data on machine performance. By using AR headsets, 
                technicians can quickly identify issues and make repairs without having 
                to shut down the entire production line. This technology not only saves 
                time but also reduces costs associated with downtime.</p>
          
          <p>In conclusion, extended reality (XR) technology is changing the way companies 
            operate, providing innovative solutions to real-world problems. From improving 
            remote collaboration to enhancing customer experiences, XR technology is being 
            used to transform a variety of industries. As companies continue to face new 
            challenges, XR technology will undoubtedly play an even more significant role 
            in solving them. The possibilities for XR technology are endless, and it's an 
            exciting time for those working in this space.</p>
