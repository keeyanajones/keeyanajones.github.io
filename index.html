            <strong>What I'm playing and Obsessed with</strong>:
            <ul>  
              <li>Minecraft</li>
              <li>Death Stranding</li> 
            </ul>
          
            <p>Lately, none of the games that have come out have made me excited.  
              But, there are certain older titles that captivate my heart and mind, 
              keeping me up for hours on end. Two such games that have always been 
              an obsessions for me and many others are Minecraft and Death Stranding. 
              Each of these games offers a unique experience, filled with distinctive 
              rewards and challenges that keep players engaged and  thirsty for more. 
              I typically delve into the enchanting realms of both Minecraft and 
              Death Stranding, exploring the rewards they offer and the obstacles 
              they present.</p>

            <h3>Minecraft</h3> 
            <p>Unleash Your Creativity and Conquer the Blocks Minecraft, 
              a sandbox-style game, has taken the world by storm with its pixelated 
              charm and limitless possibilities. It offers a virtual canvas where 
              players can unleash their creativity and build magnificent structures, 
              explore vast landscapes, and embark on exciting adventures.</p>

            <h3>Rewards in Minecraft:</h3>
            
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Creative Expression</strong>: 
                Minecraft rewards players with the satisfaction of bringing their 
                wildest imaginations to life. Whether it's constructing towering 
                castles, intricate redstone mechanisms, or sprawling cities, the 
                sense of achievement from creating something unique is unparalleled.</li>
              <li><strong>Exploration and Discovery</strong>: 
                The game's procedurally generated worlds offer endless exploration 
                opportunities. Discovering hidden caves, rare resources, and unique 
                biomes rewards players with a sense of wonder and the chance to 
                uncover secrets hidden beneath the surface.</li>
              <li><strong>Collaboration and Community</strong>: 
                Minecraft's multiplayer mode allows players to connect with friends 
                and collaborate on epic projects. The bonds forged and shared 
                accomplishments in cooperative gameplay are truly rewarding.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Challenges in Minecraft:</h3>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Survival Mode</strong>: 
                In survival mode, players face the challenge of gathering resources, 
                fending off hostile creatures, and maintaining their health and hunger. 
                Overcoming these obstacles requires strategic planning, quick thinking, 
                and adaptability.</li>
              <li><strong>Redstone Engineering</strong>: 
                Minecraft's redstone system provides a complex and rewarding challenge 
                for those who enjoy engineering and automation. Mastering the 
                intricacies of redstone circuits can unlock a world of limitless 
                possibilities.</li>
              <li><strong>Monumental Undertakings</strong>: Undertaking large-scale 
                projects in Minecraft, such as constructing a replica of a famous 
                landmark or building an intricate transportation system, can be 
                time-consuming and require careful planning and perseverance.</li>
            </ol>


            <h3>Death Stranding</h3> 
            <p>An Epic Journey of Connection and Survival Death 
              Stranding, an unconventional and thought-provoking game, invites 
              players to embark on an epic journey in a post-apocalyptic world. 
              It combines exploration, stealth, and survival mechanics with a 
              profound narrative, creating a unique and immersive experience.  
              This is why Death Stranding is the only game I have 100% of the 
              trophies and still can't stop playing for too long without having 
              withdrawal symptoms.</p>
