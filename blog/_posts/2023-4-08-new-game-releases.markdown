## What I'm playing and Obsessed with:

 - Minecraft
 - Minecraft Dungons
 - Red Dead Redemption 2 Online

Each game offers its own unique challenges and rewards, and I love them. Whether I'm building my modern farmhouse in Minecraft, fighting then dying my way through dungeons in Minecraft Dungeons, or collecting items in Red Dead Redemption 2 Online with a map on Github, I'm always having a blast. If you haven't played any of these games yet, I highly recommend them.

## When I'm playing: Random

Are you a gamer? If so, you're not alone. I am currently hooked on three different games: Minecraft, Minecraft Dungeons, and Red Dead Redemption 2 Online. Each game has its own unique challenges and rewards, and I can't get enough of them.
Minecraft: Building my Own World

This game has been around for over a decade, and it's still keeping me up all night trying to hatch turtle eggs. I recently started my own Realms server, and I've been having a blast building all sorts of things. From building houses to having a empty village with villagers living in a bunker only trading with me. I've been trying to get that pigstep disc on this world but I still haven't found it this time.

One of the coolest things I've built so far is a bed with trap doors. It took me hours of intense focus to gather all the materials and design the layout, but the end result was totally worth it. I've also built a few village structures and given the locals fines for not fixing the roads. I love fixing the roads and working among the local yocals.

Minecraft mining is relaxing and peaceful, but it can also be challenging at times. Especially when you don't sleep at night, and get too focused on building But, I love the freedom that the game offers to create my own structures.

## Minecraft Dungeons: A Tougher Challenge

This game is a bit different from the original Minecraft, as it's more of a dungeon crawler. You play as a hero, exploring dungeons and fighting monsters along the way. It's a lot of fun, but it's also tougher than you might think.

I keep dying in Dungeons, but that's part of what makes the game so addictive. Like old games you get 3 lives. Each time I die, I learn a little bit more about the game and how to beat the different enemies and figure out where to go. It can be a frustrating game at times, but it's also incredibly satisfying when you finally regenerate a potion. I try to run or wait till I get the potion back.

## Red Dead Redemption 2 Online: Collecting as a Hobby

Finally, this game is set in the Old West, and it's all about cowboy life. You can go on missions, hunt for animals, or just explore the massive open world.

One of the things I've been doing in Red Dead Redemption 2 Online is collecting. I bought the Collector's Bag, which allows me to collect all sorts of items like arrowheads, jewelry, and fossils. Its not a boring hobby, but there's something satisfying about finding stuff and finishing a collection or completing sets.

In my latest Twitch live stream, I spent most of the time looking at the map, trying to figure out where I was; and all the different collectibles were. It might not have been the most lit stream, but it was a lot of fun for me. The longest I was on github in a while; and it was to look at a map for Red Dead Redemption.

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, I love the miner lifestyle and obsess over two Minecraft games and Red Dead Redemption 2 Online. Each game offers a unique world to survive, challenges and rewards.

I will always be a mining enthusiast building things in my Minecraft or fighting my way through dungeons. I think this weekend is going to be about collecting items in Red Dead Redemption 2 Online, its fun. If you haven't played any of these games yet, I highly recommend them.
