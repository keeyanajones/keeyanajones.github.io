# Reality: EXtended

## What Is Extended Reality?

XR is a universal term inclusive to immersive learning technologies VR, AR, and MR. These technologies extend reality by adding to or simulating the real world through digital materials, and are an effective way to modernize corporate training programs.

By integrating XR into your training, you can immerse your learners in a multisensory environment that's more interactive, engaging, and effective long-term.
