## Working with AWS

I joined AWS Skill Builder in December of last year, accessed AWS Digital Training, on-demand courses, and more. With the new learning center, I explored learning plans and digital courses to help grow my career and achieve goals on my schedule. I still haven't completed the course. I really enjoy FreeCodeCamp's way of offering material and often go on my own learning journey sparked by something I see they mention on Twitter.

Check out the [Skill Builder AWS](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/home) and [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com) for more info on how to get the most out of AWS Training.
