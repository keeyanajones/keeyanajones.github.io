Are you ready to dive into ai technology but feel like you don't fit into just one box? You're not alone. As someone who started out as a consultant and JavaScript enthusiast in the 90's, I found myself pulled in different directions as my interests expanded beyond coding.

In this post, I'll share my journey of how I've transformed into a one-person IT consulting, social media, gaming, and learning Empress.

It all started with my passion for coding. When I was 19 I was drawn to the logic and creativity of problem solving programming. I started off with the basics of HTML and CSS, and then moved on to JavaScript. I found myself captivated by the endless possibilities of the language and in later years began to explore various frameworks like React and Angular. I worked on several projects as a Freelance IT consultant in Michigan, and I enjoyed the challenge of solving a problem with code.


However, after experiencing a health change I started to feel like there was more to technology than just coding. I became interested in social media and its impact on our daily lives. I began to research how social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook use algorithms to recommend content to users. I started to think about how I could use my coding skills to develop algorithms that could display content people would enjoy using. I even started using my own social media account and began experimenting with different types of content.

At the same time, I found myself becoming more interested in gaming. I had always enjoyed playing video games and it was my secret; because back then gaming was a “nerdy” thing and Live Streaming was new. But as I learned more about the gaming industry, I became fascinated by how games are developed and marketed. I started to research how game developers use social media, live streaming, and analytics to track user behavior to make decisions. I even began to think about how I could develop my own game studio and market it to a broader audience. Other Developers

As my interests expanded, I realized that I was no longer just an IT consultant or a JavaScript developer. I was a value creator or multi-disciplinary tech enthusiast influencer or just a woman who was passionate about exploring new areas of technology with an Detroiters style. I started to think about how I could use my various skills to create new products and services that would help others. I began to explore different online learning platforms like Youtube and Freecodecamp to expand my knowledge in different areas.

Today, I'm proud to say that I've transformed into a one-person technology skills Empress.

I'm constantly learning new things and exploring new areas of technology. I'm excited to see where my journey takes me next and I encourage you to do the same.
