## My Side Hustle Experience

They say the US job market is strong and unemployment is at a five-decade low, but inflation rose over 7% in 2022. Everyone and their auntie is looking for a side hustle to make more money because of the cost of food alone. I have been obsessed the art of building side hustles and specifically a passive income. At least, the idea of a side gig that wouldn't require a large amount of resources to manage in 2023.

Thus, what I did at the end of 2022 was begin developing plans and establishing various ways to offer my services.

Then, last week I read this Bloomberg article about the top 10 side hustles and was inspired to change a few things this month. The most interesting thing about the article was I need all the gigs offered and can do most of them. Some of these side hustles are on my list but I assumed that they won't generate enough money based on the amount of time I would have to dedicate to them. Clearly, I have to change the way I think about making money, use what I do have more effectively, and managing my time better.

In addition to the Bloomberg article, I read similar articles on time.com and cnbc.com that shown me how lucrative the side hustles I've been avoiding can be.
