This is Not A Guide

I have no idea how to create an AI-powered app using JavaScript. I know I should but I don't and for the last few months I have been using Chatgpt to do stuff but most interesting is I've been learning by doing. I get obsessed and think about it, over analyzing. I got obsessed with prompts and knowing what to ask first and spent a lot of time on that. I finally, learning about roles and how you can do some interesting things to save time. I think I'm ready to build but when I get down to work I like to do it in big long sprints. My goal is to build:

    Chatbot
    Recommendation Engine
    Fraud and Anomaly Detection
    Smart Home Automation
    Personalized E - learning Courses

I also want a system, a collection of interconnected parts or components that work together to achieve a specific goal or function by taking inputs, performing processes, and producing outputs in 28-30 days. June 1st - July 8th. . NOW a simplified timeline, and actual development times vary depending on the complexity and technologies involved:
Phase 1: Planning and Setup Week 1 (June 1 - June 7)
Day 1: Define the purpose and target audience of the tool.
Day 2: Choose the framework or platform for development (e.g., Discord.js, Tensorflow, chatgpt, slack, trello ,youtube, google, amazon, etc.).
Day 3: Design the conversational flows and outline the main features.
Day 4-5: Set up the development environment and install necessary tools.
Day 6-7: Research and gather relevant resources, tutorials, and sample code.
Phase 2: Development Week 2-3 (June 8 - June 21)
Day 8-9: Implement the basic bot functionality, such as connecting to Discord and receiving messages.
Day 10-11: Integrate a natural language understanding (NLU) library or service for processing user input.
Day 12-13: Develop the core conversational logic and response generation based on the defined conversational flows.
Day 14-15: Test the bot's functionality and make necessary refinements.
Phase 3: Enhancements and Testing Limited Preview Week 4 (June 22 - June 28)
Day 16-17: Add additional features and functionalities, such as handling user commands or retrieving external data.
Day 18-19: Test the chatbot extensively, simulate various user scenarios, and refine the responses.
Day 20-21: Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback and make necessary improvements.
Phase 4: Deployment and Refinement Preview Week 5 (June 29 - July 5)
Day 22: Deploy the chatbot to Discord and test its integration in a live environment.
Day 23-24: Monitor the chatbot's performance, gather user feedback, and address any reported issues.
Day 25-26: Make necessary refinements based on user feedback and usage patterns.
Phase 5: Finalization and Documentation (2 days) General Release Day 27-28 (July 6 - July 7)
Day 27: Conduct final testing and quality assurance (QA) checks.
Day 28: Prepare documentation, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and any necessary documentation for future maintenance.


Please note this timeline assumes a focused and efficient development process with no drama. I also had to adjust the timeline according to specific marketing campaign circumstances and available time. It's also important to allocate time for learning and research if you're new to development but I like to live dangerously. I have so experience and whatnot.
