## AI: Social Change and Improving Life

Is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning being used in ways to address social challenges and improve lives?
I've been asking this question alot lately and in my experience I haven't been able to get a straight answer. While, some say healthcare, disaster response to environmental sustainability, and financial inclusion have all benefited from AI, I can't really find the day to day proof these technologies have created real and lasting impact.

People and social media post always say things like, "potentially or the future", but no one is really making a difference in the lives of people who otherwise wouldn't have the benefits of this technology.

Initiatives such as AI4SG and AI for Everyone are leading the way in leveraging the potential of AI and machine learning for social good, while startups and research organizations are pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible. Yea, yea, yea but who is it really helping day to day.

There are real challenges that need to be addressed, the future of AI and machine learning for social good needs to do more than look bright. It needs to invest in the people who need the benefits of the research, education, and collaboration most NOW.
