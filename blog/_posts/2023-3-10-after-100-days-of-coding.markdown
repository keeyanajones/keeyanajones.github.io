## After 100 Days of Coding

10 Things Learned From 100 Days of Coding

-I am not a developer anymore, I'm more
-I'm a solopreneur, meaning that one person owns the company, there are no partners and employees. When necessary, I outsource or hire subcontractors or consultants to get work done but primarily I am a single individual managing and running the company.

The idea of the one person business model has always interested me. So, for 2023 I plan to focus on changing my business and pursuing this model.
    
-I like learning on FreeCodeCamp (and other similar sites) independently
-I can make alot more money
-I use social media, games, and code alot
-I am kinda a math nerd
-I need to know more about AI
-Immersion and Extended Reality is my Jam
-I give alot of free consultations on freelance sites and social media
-I can design, develop, and release my own apps, games, and content
-I still love coding, learning, and working with others
