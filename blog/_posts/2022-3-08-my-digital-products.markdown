## My Digital Products

Digital products are nonphysical items that customers purchase and use online. You can’t hold, taste, or touch these products, but everyone consumes them – from newsletters, ebooks, podcasts, and videos. Often, influencers and content creators use digital products as lead magnets for product launches. These products are often educational or entertaining.

### Why I'm Selling My Own Digital Products

A successful digital product can help earn passive income and support an entire business around it.

    Low Cost
    These products take the stress of expensive costs and overhead off by eliminating manufacturing, packing, shipping, and storage. The product will never be out of stock! Once created, you can sell thousands of copies of it or its updated version to enjoy profitability.
    
    Less Risk
    There’s less risk involved selling digital goods. If your product fails, you can get in-depth insights into fixing it and improvement to create an item that customers love! If your product is easy-to-use, well-designed, engaging, and valuable, people will want to use it!
    
    High Scalability
    These products connect with a broader, more diverse audience without hard work selling it.
    
    For instance, if you want to open a pharmacy, you can offer health screening, but you can only serve people in your area with insurance you accept. Additionally, you’ll have to pay for the equipment, testing, and space.
    Conversely, creating an online pharmacy program provides access to a massive audience, making it easier for your target market to find you.
    
    Easily Automated
    A high-quality membership site and multiple payment methods can direct attention, time, and efforts into marketing and creating products easily.
    
    Passive Income
    These products are one way of building passive income because they require little effort after the launch.
    
    A service business only makes money when you’re working, and an e-commerce business involves fulfilling orders and stocking items.
    
    However, these products enable making money offline since you don’t have to re-stock them, making it the ultimate business model!
    
    Low Entry Barrier
    Starting is creating and launching products with a laptop or mobile phone and a little cash. While my certification and professional experience are a plus point, they are not required.
    
    You can leverage skills, life experiences, and hobbies to develop a digital product.

Although it’s challenging to grab the target audience’s attention, you can grow and scale a brand successfully with the right strategies and tactics. The primary reason digital goods fail is the lack of planning and market knowledge.
