# Training - Learning to Learn

## Techniques I use to Learn

### FOCUS ON ONE THING MULTITASKING IS A LIE

I used to always try to multitask and then I saw this video about multitasking that said multitasking was a waste of time. So, now I try not to multitask and instead, I listen to music for focus. Lofi music is ok but one of my favorite types of music to study and work too is coffee house jazz. For example, listen and enjoy.

### TAKE A BREAK

To accomplish long periods of focused thinking I use the Pomodoro Technique and timer. I do deep work, or uninterrupted work for about 50 minutes and then as a reward I take a 10 minute break to do anything I want to takes my mind off the task at hand.

### PRACTICE

To improve performance at anything you need to practice. Deliberate practice is the best technique for achieving expert performance in every field. But there's much more to deliberate practice than 10,000 hours. Mastery is also a huge topic that can be overwhelming. I would suggest Robert Greens book Mastery but there are many great books on the topic. Here is a summary video that might be helpful.

### KNOW THYSELF

Understand that people learn in different ways. There are many different learning styles and each has its own advantages and disadvantages, the first step in learning how to approach unfamiliar material is discovering your learning style here.
