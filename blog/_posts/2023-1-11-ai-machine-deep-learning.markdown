# AI: Machine vs Deep Learning

Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset, an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that offers the ability to the system to learn and improve from experience without being programmed to that level. Machine Learning uses data to train and find accurate results. Machine learning focuses on the development of a computer program that accesses the data and uses it to learn from itself.

Deep Learning: Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning where the artificial neural network and the recurrent neural network come in relation. The algorithms are created exactly just like machine learning but it consists of many more levels of algorithms. All these networks of the algorithm are together called the artificial neural network. In much simpler terms, it replicates just like the human brain as all the neural networks are connected in the brain, which exactly is the concept of deep learning. It solves all the complex problems with the help of algorithms and its process.
