<h2 id="what-is-extended-reality">What Is Extended Reality?</h2>

<p>XR is a universal term inclusive to immersive learning technologies VR, AR, and MR. These technologies extend reality by adding to or simulating the real world through digital materials, and are an effective way to modernize corporate training programs.</p>

<p>By integrating XR into your training, you can immerse your learners in a multisensory environment that’s more interactive, engaging, and effective long-term.</p>

<p>Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset, an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that offers the ability to the system to learn and improve from experience without being programmed to that level. Machine Learning uses data to train and find accurate results. Machine learning focuses on the development of a computer program that accesses the data and uses it to learn from itself.</p>

<p>Deep Learning: Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning where the artificial neural network and the recurrent neural network come in relation. The algorithms are created exactly just like machine learning but it consists of many more levels of algorithms. All these networks of the algorithm are together called the artificial neural network. In much simpler terms, it replicates just like the human brain as all the neural networks are connected in the brain, which exactly is the concept of deep learning. It solves all the complex problems with the help of algorithms and its process.</p>

<h2 id="techniques-i-use-to-learn">Techniques I use to Learn</h2>

<h3 id="focus-on-one-thing-multitasking-is-a-lie">FOCUS ON ONE THING MULTITASKING IS A LIE</h3>

<p>I used to always try to multitask and then I saw this video about multitasking that said multitasking was a waste of time. So, now I try not to multitask and instead, I listen to music for focus. Lofi music is ok but one of my favorite types of music to study and work too is coffee house jazz. For example, listen and enjoy.</p>

<h3 id="take-a-break">TAKE A BREAK</h3>

<p>To accomplish long periods of focused thinking I use the Pomodoro Technique and timer. I do deep work, or uninterrupted work for about 50 minutes and then as a reward I take a 10 minute break to do anything I want to takes my mind off the task at hand.</p>

<h3 id="practice">PRACTICE</h3>

<p>To improve performance at anything you need to practice. Deliberate practice is the best technique for achieving expert performance in every field. But there’s much more to deliberate practice than 10,000 hours. Mastery is also a huge topic that can be overwhelming. I would suggest Robert Greens book Mastery but there are many great books on the topic. Here is a summary video that might be helpful.</p>

<h3 id="know-thyself">KNOW THYSELF</h3>

<p>Understand that people learn in different ways. There are many different learning styles and each has its own advantages and disadvantages, the first step in learning how to approach unfamiliar material is discovering your learning style here.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Training - Learning to Learn]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2023 The Year of The Side Hustles</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/side/hustles/2023/01/09/2023-year-of-the-side-hustle.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2023 The Year of The Side Hustles" /><published>2023-01-09T19:39:46-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-09T19:39:46-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/side/hustles/2023/01/09/2023-year-of-the-side-hustle</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/side/hustles/2023/01/09/2023-year-of-the-side-hustle.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="my-side-hustle-experience">My Side Hustle Experience</h2>

<p>They say the US job market is strong and unemployment is at a five-decade low, but inflation rose over 7% in 2022. Everyone and their auntie is looking for a side hustle to make more money because of the cost of food alone. I have been obsessed the art of building side hustles and specifically a passive income. At least, the idea of a side gig that wouldn’t require a large amount of resources to manage in 2023.</p>

<p>Thus, what I did at the end of 2022 was begin developing plans and establishing various ways to offer my services.</p>

<p>Then, last week I read this Bloomberg article about the top 10 side hustles and was inspired to change a few things this month. The most interesting thing about the article was I need all the gigs offered and can do most of them. Some of these side hustles are on my list but I assumed that they won’t generate enough money based on the amount of time I would have to dedicate to them. Clearly, I have to change the way I think about making money, use what I do have more effectively, and managing my time better.</p>

<p>In addition to the Bloomberg article, I read similar articles on time.com and cnbc.com that shown me how lucrative the side hustles I’ve been avoiding can be.</p>

<p>Last year I told someone about my work and before I could even finish my sentence, they said, “I live in reality…” and went on to say “now go and play like your working…”</p>

<p>I laughed and thought to myself, goofy the metaverse market is expected to be a $800 billion market by 2024, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Roblox CEO David Baszucki, meanwhile, projects a total addressable market of around $200 billion or more each in the categories of mobile, streaming content, and social media.</p>

<p>In fact, there are much more audacious estimates — Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak vaguely refers to an $8 trillion total addressable market among U.S. consumers — that come with multiple caveats. Adoption “won’t be rapid or easy,” Nowak says, because of uncertainty over the metaverse experience, consumer distrust toward Facebook with their personal and enterprise data, and Facebook’s lack of enterprise tool expertise.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-connection-will-be-in-3d">The future of connection will be in 3D</h2>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the general study of making intelligent machines. Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on the ability of machines to receive data and learn for themselves without being programmed with rules. ML differs from traditional programming by allowing you to teach your program with examples rather than a list of instructions. Instead of writing instructions, or rules, while programming, machine learning enables you to “train” an algorithm so that it can learn on its own, and then adjust and improve as it learns more about the information it is processing.</p>

<p>I am a little familiar with these concepts but want to learn more so I’ve been working on Machine Learning, AI Experiments, examples, problem framing, data sources, responsibly, and more. I recently got into TensorFlow and now I am learning how to use AI and TF with my development. I have a few products I want to create in the next few weeks using TF to see if they would profitable.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-mern-stack">Using the MERN Stack</h2>
<p>Let’s try to update my MERN Full Stack skill set in 2022. Since, I recently updated my MongoDB Atlas and AWS (Amazon Web Services) accounts, I want to use MERN to quickly build a few applications. The idea is to re-familiarize myself with this stack and build modular components and snippets that I can use to build several apps over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Before I begin, I have to make sure I update Node.js and React.js basics; then make sure Create React App is updated and installed. Next, I will need access to the MongoDB Atlas database to add a database deployment and connect the app. The full code tutorial for building a full stack MERN application with MongoDB Atlas is available in this GitHub repo.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-mern-stack">What is the MERN Stack?</h2>

<p>The MERN stack is a web development framework made up of the stack of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MongoDB - It’s an open-source NoSQL cross-platform document-oriented database.</li>
  <li>ExpressJS - It’s a web-based application framework work with Node JS, It helps to build web apps and RESTful APIs.</li>
  <li>React - React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. React is a User Interface (UI) library. React is a tool for building UI components</li>
  <li>NodeJS - It is a free JavaScript run-time environment, It executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is available for macOS, Windows, Linux, and Unix.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is one of the several variants of the MEAN stack. The MERN stack visualized When you use the MERN stack, you work with React to implement the presentation layer, Express and Node to make up the middle or application layer, and MongoDB to create the database layer. I utilize these four technologies to develop a basic application that is able to record the information and then display it using a React.</p>

<p>I am using the following plugins and tools to create the MERN Stack apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NodeJS</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>MongooseJS</li>
  <li>ExpressJS</li>
  <li>ReactJS</li>
  <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
</ul>
