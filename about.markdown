I'm a software engineer with over 20 years of IT experience as a Consultant specializing in creating web experiences that make users enjoy time with brands. 

I am a developer with a practical, authentic, hands-on approach to IT. My goal is to help market, advise, promote, predict, build anticipation, deliver products, create demand through social media, advertising, and networking.

I am a passionate leader launching digital content to new markets. I am also a strategic thinker that enjoys research, product development, management, and planning. 

My love of gaming, live streams, application development, music, anime, film, radio, social media, and my experience in data-oriented technologies lead me to this exciting path. 

I always enjoy challenges and discover solutions.  You can find out more info about me, as well as my work at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keeyana-jones-5a275514)
