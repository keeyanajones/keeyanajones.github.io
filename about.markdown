## Veteran Logic, Agentic Future    

### Architecting Systems Since 1996. Evolving with AI Since 2018

With three decades of full stack engineering under my belt, I don't just write code I build durable logic. While the tools have shifted from early web stacks to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Agentic AI, my core mission remains the same: solving complex problems with "Trench Logic"-- deep, grounded and resilient.

### Current Focus: The AI Frontier
    
For the last 6 years, I've pivoted my 30 year foundation into the AI space, moving beyond simple prompts into Agentic Maintenance Digital Twins and Idiosyncratic Mimicry. I am currently developing a suit for community and service driven projects.

### Community Experiments
- Lake Erie AI Sentinel: An environmental monitoring experiment leveraging AI for local ecological data.
- 48 Hour Crisis Navigator Engine: Rapid response logic for emergency navigator and resource allocation.
- Minecraft Aether Economy: Exploring de centralized economic models within virtual environments.
  

### Professional Services & Studio Projects

- Trench Logic Studio: High level architectural consulting and full stack execution
- Agentic Maintenance Digital Twin (AMDT): Predictive AI Systems for industrial and digital infrastructure
- Brand Sentinel Document Engine: Advanced NLP for brand consistency and document integrity
- DetroitOmnifield AI: Hyper local AI integration for the Detroit tech ecosystem.
- ValueVision AI: Computer vision and data analysis for value stream mapping
- Idiosyncratic Mimicry (Gemini/GCP): An experimental deep dive into persona driven AI using Googles Gemini Flash Models  
- The Launch Pad Foundry
- Motor City Mesh
